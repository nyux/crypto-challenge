# Overview

Solutions to the Matasano Crypto Challenges. Right now I'm doing everything in C so I can get a better grasp of the language. Might add other languages later if I feel the need/want to practice.

#Compiling

To compile, either use clang or add `std=c11` when using gcc.

# To-Do

* finish the first set of problems
* make certain files read input from stdin (undecided)
